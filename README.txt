This project looks at the dataset for a store which contains sales made in the past and characteristics of different stores.
The project uses this information to enable prediction of sales for the different stores. Time series techniques are used to make the predictions.

The dataset is converted into supervised learning version, this done by shifting the dataset depending on the lag we would like to predict and an LSTM model is applied to it.
